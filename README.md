HUMAN DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING

 -->Detection of humans from the image captured by the drone images and low altitude drone image using deeplearning model with convolutional nueral network

-->The final model is the model trained using 50000 images which is trained on resnet101 which is a faster-rcnn model

The project can be devided into 5 phases

1.Data set collection(image collection)
2.Data set preprocessing+Data set annottation/labelling
3.installing and deveoloping tensorflow model,installing all the required dependencies and libraries
4.Training and Testing using the dataset on the model
5.Testing with the real examples and retraing by changing various parameters

PHASE 1:DATA SET COLLECTION 

--->For better accuracy and result the model have to be trained with a well defined dataset collecting the data set is the first and major major work

-->collected  50000 ariel and drone images

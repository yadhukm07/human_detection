HUMAN DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING

 -->Detection of humans from the image captured by the drone images and low altitude drone image using deeplearning model with convolutional nueral network

-->The final model is the model trained using 50000 images which is trained on resnet101 which is a faster-rcnn model

The project can be devided into 4 phases

1.Data set collection(image collection)
